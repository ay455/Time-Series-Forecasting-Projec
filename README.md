# Time-Series-Forecasting-Project

2. Entity: Country name 
Code: Country code 
Year: Year of the data point 
Day: Specific date
Average surface temperature: Actual recorded temperature (The temperature of the air measured 2 meters above.)
3. Data collection by NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS),
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
Berkeley Earth, and
Met Office Hadley Centre (UK); The data was collected on a daily basis and combined afterwards by country 
4. I chose this dataset because climate change is a big issue, and I’m curious to see how temperatures have changed over time. Using real data to make predictions is exciting, and it’s a great way to practice time series forecasting with something that matters globally.
